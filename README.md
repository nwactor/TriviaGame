# Space Trivia

This is a short game of Trivia that runs on a single browser page. It was
written for the purpose of displaying proficiency in general JavaScript, jQuery, and
Javascript delay and interval functions.

The game is timed and runs by itself - once the user presses start, a round of trivia
ends once they guess an answer or run out of time. After each question, the answer
and a Gif will be displayed. After four seconds the game will automatically continue.
At the end, the user's stats (correct, incorrect, out of time) will be displayed 
and the option to restart given.
